    "The user is encountering an error when trying to push Git LFS tracked files:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This repository is over its data quota. Account responsible for LFS bandwidth should purchase more data packs to restore access.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the issue**\n",
    "   - The error message indicates that the repository has exceeded its data quota for Git LFS (Large File Storage).\n",
    "   - This is likely due to the size or number of large files being tracked by Git LFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check current LFS usage**\n",
    "   - Run the following command to see the current LFS objects:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     git lfs ls-files\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This will show you which files are being tracked by Git LFS and their sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Review Git LFS pricing and quotas**\n",
    "   - Visit GitHub's pricing page to understand the current LFS storage and bandwidth limits for your account type.\n",
    "   - Free accounts typically have lower limits compared to paid plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Options to resolve the issue**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. **Purchase more data packs**\n",
    "      - If you need to keep all current LFS objects and continue using LFS extensively:\n",
    "        1. Go to your GitHub account settings.\n",
    "        2. Navigate to the Billing section.\n",
    "        3. Look for options to purchase additional data packs for Git LFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. **Optimize repository**\n",
    "      - If purchasing more data is not an option, consider optimizing your repository:\n",
    "        1. Remove unnecessary large files from LFS tracking.\n",
    "        2. Use `.gitignore` to exclude large files that don't need version control.\n",
    "        3. Consider using alternative storage solutions for very large assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "   c. **Clean up LFS cache**\n",
    "      - Sometimes, cleaning up the LFS cache can help:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        git lfs prune\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reconfigure Git LFS tracking**\n",
    "   - Review your `.gitattributes` file to ensure only necessary file types are tracked:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     git lfs track\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Modify tracking as needed:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     git lfs track \"*.psd\"  # Track PSD files\n",
    "     git lfs untrack \"*.zip\"  # Stop tracking ZIP files\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Commit changes and retry push**\n",
    "   - After making necessary changes:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     git add .gitattributes\n",
    "     git commit -m \"Update Git LFS tracking\"\n",
    "     git push\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **If issues persist**\n",
    "   - Contact GitHub support for further assistance.\n",
    "   - They may be able to provide more specific guidance based on your account and repository details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to regularly monitor your Git LFS usage to avoid hitting quotas in the future. Consider setting up alerts or regularly checking your GitHub account's storage usage statistics.\"\"\"\n",
