    "To demonstrate how to use `FlowJudge` in the Haystack framework, we are going to evaluate the pipeline using a combination of statistical evaluators and model-based evaluators.\n",

    "- Semantic Answer Similarity: Evaluates the semantic similarity of the generated answer and the ground truth rather than their lexical overlap.\n",
    "- Context Relevancy: Assesses the relevance of the retrieved documents to the query.\n",
    "- Faithfulness: Evaluates to what extent a generated answer is based on retrieved documents\n",
    "\n",
    "For context relevancy and faithfulness, we will create FlowJudge evaluators so we don't need to rely on proprietary large models.\n",
    "\n",

    "First of all, we need to obtain the generated answers from the RAG pipeline.\n",

We are limiting the number of questions for now to 10 to avoid hitting the rate limit. If the execution crashes, you can resume from where it left off by running the cell again."

       " '1. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\\nYOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\\'S OR PARTY\\'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\\'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\\'s limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay\\'s right to appeal the court\\'s decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\\n\\n2. Arbitration Procedures\\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\\n\\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA\\'s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA\\'s rules are available at www.adr.org. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or the court.\\n\\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link. The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.\\n\\nIf you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA\\'s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\\n\\nThe arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator\\'s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\\n\\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator\\'s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\\n\\n3. Costs of Arbitration\\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\\'s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement (\"Arbitration Procedures\") and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA\\'s rules.\\n\\n4. Severability\\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\\n\\n5. Opt-Out Procedure\\nIF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT-OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO EBAY INC., ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, 583 WEST EBAY WAY, DRAPER, UT 84020.\\n\\nFor your convenience, we are providing an Opt-Out Notice form. You must complete and mail that to us in order to opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. You must complete the Opt-Out Notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user ID(s) and email address(es) associated with the eBay Service account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of this User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.\\nA. Disputes. A dispute is any controversy between You and Zoom concerning the Services, any software related to the Services, the price of the Services, Your account, Zooms advertising, marketing, or communications, Your purchase transaction or billing, or any term of this Agreement, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of Your or Zooms intellectual property rights. As part of the best efforts process to resolve disputes, and prior to initiating arbitration proceedings, each party agrees to provide notice of the dispute to the other party, including a description of the dispute, what efforts have been made to resolve it, and what the disputing party is requesting as resolution, to legal@zoom.us.\\n\\nB. Small Claims Court Available. You may initiate an action in your local Small Claims Court if You meets the courts requirements. However, if such a claim is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court, Zoom reserves the right to require arbitration.\\n\\nC. Arbitration Procedure. Disputes not resolved pursuant to Section A or B shall be resolved through arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. For more information, see www.adr.org. Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of Your primary business location. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator must: (a) follow all applicable substantive Law; (b) follow applicable statutes of limitations; (c) honor valid claims of privilege; (d) issue a written decision including the reasons for the award. The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and costs (including reasonable attorneys fees). Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction. Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim; however, a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity .\\n\\nD. Arbitration Fees. If You are unable to afford the arbitration costs, Zoom will advance those costs to You, subject to the arbitrators determination if costs should be reimbursed to Zoom if Zoom prevails. For disputes involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAAs and arbitrators fees and expenses.\\n\\nE. Conflict with AAA Rules. This Agreement governs if there is a conflict with the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules.\\n\\nF. Requirement to File Within One Year. Notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, a claim or dispute under this Agreement must be filed in Small Claims Court or noticed for arbitration within one year of when it could first be filed, or such claim will be permanently barred.\\n\\nG. Severability. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will be resolved in court, with the balance resolved through arbitration. If any provision of this Exhibit A is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to as nearly as possible achieve the original intent of this Exhibit, inclusive of the severed provision.\\nWhen you provide content using our Services (directly or indirectly), you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise any and all Intellectual Property Rights you have in that content in connection with our provision, expansion, and promotion of our Services, in any media known now or developed in the future.

After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.\\n\\nContent will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:\\n\\nwhere your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or\\n\\nwhere deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or\\n\\nwhere deletion would restrict our ability to:\\ninvestigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);\\nprotect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;\\ncomply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or\\ncomply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;\\nin which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).\\n\\nIf you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called \"Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree\" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted. \\n3.

       " 'Welcome to Instagram!\\n\\nThese Terms of Use (or Terms) govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the Service), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.\\n\\nThe Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc.\\n\\nThe Instagram Service\\nWe agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram\\'s mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):\\n\\nOffering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.\\nPeople are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.\\n\\nFostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.\\nWe develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.\\n\\nDeveloping and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.\\nOrganizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.\\n\\nProviding consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products.\\nInstagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.\\n\\nEnsuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.\\nTo provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.\\n\\nConnecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.\\nWe use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.\\n\\nResearch and innovation.\\nWe use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.\\nPermissions You Give to Us. As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.\\nWe do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.\\nNothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a license) to provide the Service. When you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.\\nPermission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.\\nYou give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.\\nYou agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.\\nContent Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account\\n\\nWe can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people\\'s intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.\\n\\nContent will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:\\n\\nwhere your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or\\n\\nwhere deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or\\n\\nwhere deletion would restrict our ability to:\\ninvestigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);\\nprotect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;\\ncomply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or\\ncomply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;\\nin which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).\\n\\nIf you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called \"Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree\" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted. \\n']"

      "The response provided is mostly consistent with the given context, but it does introduce some minor fabrications. The context does mention that customers can obtain assistance through other means if they do not want to enable remote access support through their device, but it does not specify what those alternative means are. The response correctly states that customers can reach out through contact details provided on the Netflix Help Center webpage, such as phone numbers, email addresses, or live chat support options. However, since these specific details are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are considered minor fabrications. Therefore, the response is mostly consistent with the context, with only minor and inconsequential inconsistencies.\n",
